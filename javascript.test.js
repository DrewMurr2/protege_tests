/**
 * Make a function which calculates the angle between the hands of a clock
 * The function takes two arguments, hours, and minutes. These will be integers between 1 - 12 and 0 - 59 respectively.
 * The hour hand is assumed to move continuously (not incrementally). 
 * So that means the the position of the hour hand is affected by the minute hand.
 * The result of the function should be the angle between the hands. The result of the function should always be >= 0 and <= 180.
 * Good luck
